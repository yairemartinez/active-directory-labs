# Phase 1 – Core AD and Client Join

This phase documents domain creation and basic client integration.  
I originally completed these labs earlier and am now redoing them to record each step clearly.

**Goal:** Join Windows 10 clients to the lab.local domain, create users, and apply a basic Group Policy Object.

**Key Tasks**
- Join Windows 10 client to domain  
- Create organizational unit “LabUsers”  
- Create user “jdoe” and test login  
- Reset and unlock user passwords  
- Create FinanceGroup and assign permissions  

**Reflection**  
Documenting this again helped me understand how DNS configuration directly affects domain joins and why organized OUs simplify GPO targeting.
