# Phase 5 – Automation and Remote Operations

This phase focuses on PowerShell automation for common administrative tasks.  
The goal is to demonstrate scripting skills that support repetitive Help Desk workflows.

## Objectives
- Automate user provisioning from a CSV file
- Build a small Help Desk toolkit for resets and group changes
- Use PowerShell Remoting to manage clients without RDP

## Key Tasks
1. Write a CSV-driven user creation script.
2. Add logic to assign users to the correct OU and groups.
3. Create a simple menu-based toolkit for unlocking accounts, resetting passwords, or adding group membership.
4. Enable PowerShell Remoting on Windows clients.
5. Run remote commands from the Domain Controller to retrieve system information.

## Notes
Document the scripts used and save them in the /scripts folder.  
Screenshots of script output are helpful but optional.

## Reflection
Automation reduces manual errors and supports consistency across environments.  
Rewriting these scripts with clearer documentation makes the process easier to understand and reuse.
